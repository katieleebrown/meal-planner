# Introduction
This meal planner is being created to solve one of my most time-consuming chores: going through my go-to list of recipes, planning meals for the week and making my shopping list. This app is being designed to hold a list of a user's meals and their respective ingredient lists, a calendar where those meals can be plugged in, and a shopping list calculator that will review your recipes (along with a weekly staples list) and create your shopping list for you.

# Why It's Made
I got sick of the time I was wasting planning meals for my family, and decided to create an app that did all the heavy lifting for me.

# Tech Stack
Javascript, Node.js, Express, Postgres, Bootstrap, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS & Figma

Figma designs can be found <a href='https://www.figma.com/file/WshkHbQJI9ORXAS4dK4SBC/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=EGv2v9bZD80wMvR3-1'>here.<a>

# Optimizations
I've recently added new recipes from the Edamam API to add functionality for this app. Users can use a recipe search filter to find recipes by meal type, cuisine, and/or ingredients. The app will store that recipe ID and use it to both add to your shopping list and display the recipe when it's time to cook. I'm excited to start adding more meals into my planning!
