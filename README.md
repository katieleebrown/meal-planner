# Introduction
This meal planner is being created to solve one of my most time-consuming chores: going through my go-to list of recipes, planning meals for the week and making my shopping list. This app is being designed to hold a list of a user's meals and their respective ingredient lists, a calendar where those meals can be plugged in, and a shopping list calculator that will review your recipes (along with a weekly staples list) and create your shopping list for you.

# Why It's Made
I got sick of the time I was wasting planning meals for my family, and decided to create an app that did all the heavy lifting for me.
